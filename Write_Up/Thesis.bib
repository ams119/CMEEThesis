abstract = {In linear mixed models, model selection frequently includes the selection of random effects. Two versions ofthe Akaike information criterion, AIC, have been used, based eitheron the marginal or on the conditional distribution. We show that the marginal AIC is not an asymptotically unbiased estimator of the Akaike information, and favours smaller models without random effects. For the conditional AIC, we show that ignoring estimation uncertainty in the random effects covariance matrix, as is common practice, induces a bias that can lead to the selection of any random effect not predicted to be exactly zero. We derive an analytic representation of a corrected version of the conditional AIC, which avoids the high computational cost and imprecision of available numerical approximations. An implementation in an R package (R Development Core Team, 2010) is provided. All theoretical results are illustrated in simulation studies, and their impact in practice is investigated in an analysis of childhood malnutrition in Zambia. {\textcopyright} 2010 Biometrika Trust.},

abstract = {We examined the relationship between types of mosquito control programs and the mosquito-borne Ross River virus (RRV) disease in Queensland, Australia. Mosquito control information was collected through a survey of the responsible agencies (local governments), and RRV disease notification data were provided by the Queensland state health authority. The study developed a typology of mosquito control programs, based on the approaches used. Based on the analysis of data on RRV disease rates between mosquito control types within 4 climatic regions, each region had different combinations of mosquito control strategies in their programs; there were also general similarities in the relationship between program types and RRV rates between the regions. The long-term RRV disease rates were lower in areas where the mosquito control program included pre-emptive (rather than reactive) surveillance based on an extensive (rather than incomplete) knowledge of mosquito habitats, and where treatment of both saltwater and freshwater habitats (compared to only saltwater habitats, in coastal areas) occurred. The data indicate that mosquito control is an effective public health intervention to reduce mosquito-borne disease; hence, climate change adaptation strategies should ensure that adequate resources are available for effective vector control so as to manage the risk of mosquito-borne diseases. {\textcopyright} 2011 by The American Mosquito Control Association, Inc.},

abstract = {Over the last four decades, a number of arthropod-borne infections have been recognized for the first time. Some have become of considerable public health importance, such as dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF), and others are spreading geographically and their incidence is increasing. There has been an important recrudescence of several long-known vector-borne diseases. Malaria, leishmaniasis, dengue, and plague have resurged in numerous foci, in some cases where they were thought to be under effective control. In most instances, the appearance of new diseases and syndromes and the resurgence of old can be associated with ecological changes that have favored increased vector densities. Dam construction, irrigation and other development projects, urbanization, and deforestation have all resulted in changes in vector population densities that appear to have enabled the emergence of new diseases and the resurgence of old diseases. Greatly increased human travel has spread infectious agents, introducing them into areas in which they had been hitherto absent. It is essential to understand the factors that caused increased vector densities and hence the transmission of disease to prevent the emergence and resurgence of more diseases, as well as to serve as a basis for effective control.},

abstract = {Mosquito populations are sensitive to long-term variations in climate and short-term variations in weather. Mosquito abundance is a key determinant of outbreaks of mosquito-borne diseases, such as West Nile virus (WNV). In this work, the short-term impact of weather conditions (temperature and precipitation) on Culex pipiens L.-Culex restuans Theobald mosquito abundance in Peel Region, Ontario, Canada, was investigated using the 2002-2009 mosquito data collected from the WNV surveillance program managed by Ontario Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care and a gamma-generalized linear model. There was a clear association between weather conditions (temperature and precipitation) and mosquito abundance, which allowed the definition of threshold criteria for temperature and precipitation conditions for mosquito population growth. A predictive statistical model for mosquito population based on weather conditions was calibrated using real weather and mosquito surveillance data, and validated using a subset of surveillance data. Results showed that WNV vector abundance on any one day could be predicted with reasonable accuracy from relationships with mean degree-days {\textgreater}9Â°C over the 11 preceding days, and precipitation 35 d previously. This finding provides optimism for the development of weather-generated forecasting for WNV risk that could be used in decision support systems for interventions such as mosquito control. {\textcopyright} 2011 Entomological Society of America.},

We develop a simple model, which treats the mosquito reproductive cycle as a phase oscillator that responds to rainfall frequency forcing. This model reproduces observed mosquito population dynamics and indicates that mosquito-borne disease transmission can be sensitive to rainfall frequency. These findings indicate that changes to the hydrologic cycle, in particular the frequency of moderate to heavy rainfall events, could have a profound effect on the transmission rates of some mosquito-borne diseases. {\textcopyright} 2007 Shaman, Day.},

abstract = {The parasites that cause malaria depend on Anopheles mosquitoes for transmission; because of this, mosquito population dynamics are a key determinant of malaria risk. Development and survival rates of both the Anopheles mosquitoes and the Plasmodium parasites that cause malaria depend on temperature, making this a potential driver of mosquito population dynamics and malaria transmission. We developed a temperature-dependent, stage-structured delayed differential equation model to better understand how climate determines risk. Including the full mosquito life cycle in the model reveals that the mosquito population abundance is more sensitive to temperature than previously thought because it is strongly influenced by the dynamics of the juvenile mosquito stages whose vital rates are also temperature-dependent. Additionally, the model predicts a peak in abundance of mosquitoes old enough to vector malaria at more accurate temperatures than previous models. Our results point to the importance of incorporating detailed vector biology into models for predicting the risk for vector borne diseases. {\textcopyright} 2013 Beck-Johnson et al.},

abstract = {Statistical methods for modelling plant species distributions are difficult to evaluate using field data because "truth" is unknown. Artificial data based on explicit theory can be used as "truth". Statistical models should be capable of recovering "truth" if they are to be useful when applied to field data. Use of artificial data in plant community ecology to evaluate statistical methods is reviewed. Two plant community theoretical models based on the continuum concept are identified for describing species responses, the Swan/ter Braak model (Gaussian symmetric unimodal responses) and the Ellenberg/Minchin model (skewed unimodal responses). Theory regarding both indirect and direct environmental gradients is used to simulate a realistic species/environment data set. The software package COMPAS with a restricted set of options is used to generate two types of data set: (1) direct, where species show typical responses to variables such as radiation and (2) indirect, where variables like aspect and slope which are related to radiation by complex environmental processes. An example of generalised linear models (GLM) and generalised additive models (GAM) applied to the artificial data sets by analysts unaware of truth is presented. The results are evaluated on the following criteria: correct selection of predictors; accurate description of response curves; prediction of abundance; and ecologically rational relationships. The potential impacts of differences in the skills of the analysts are discussed. Both GLM and GAM performed well with Gaussian responses and direct gradient predictors. GAM performed marginally better with the skewed response model and direct predictors. GAM performed consistently better than GLM with the indirect predictors. The main conclusion was that the ecological knowledge and statistical skills of the analysts were more important than the method used. Crown Copyright {\textcopyright} 2006.},

abstract = {The four dengue viruses, the agents of dengue fever and dengue hemorrhagic fever in humans, are transmitted predominantly by the mosquito Aedes aegypti. The abundance and the transmission potential of Ae. aegypti are influenced by temperature and precipitation. While there is strong biological evidence for these effects, empirical studies of the relationship between climate and dengue incidence in human populations are potentially confounded by seasonal covariation and spatial heterogeneity. Using 20 years of data and a statistical approach to control for seasonality, we show a positive and statistically significant association between monthly changes in temperature and precipitation and monthly changes in dengue transmission in Puerto Rico. We also found that the strength of this association varies spatially, that this variation is associated with differences in local climate, and that this relationship is consistent with laboratory studies of the impacts of these factors on vector survival and viral replication. These results suggest the importance of temperature and precipitation in the transmission of dengue viruses and suggest a reason for their spatial heterogeneity. Thus, while dengue transmission may have a general system, its manifestation on a local scale may differ from global expectations.},

Nine chickens that ingested WNV-NY99 failed to become infected.

Yet, scant evidence is available about their relative performance in terms of accuracy and computational requirements. The purpose of this paper is to evaluate such performance across multiple forecasting horizons using a large subset of 1045 monthly time series used in the M3 Competition. After comparing the post-sample accuracy of popular ML methods with that of eight traditional statistical ones, we found that the former are dominated across both accuracy measures used and for all forecasting horizons examined. Moreover, we observed that their computational requirements are considerably greater than those of statistical methods. The paper discusses the results, explains why the accuracy of ML models is below that of statistical ones and proposes some possible ways forward. The empirical results found in our research stress the need for objective and unbiased ways to test the performance of forecasting methods that can be achieved through sizable and open competitions allowing meaningful comparisons and definite conclusions.},

The proposals avoid having to use nonparametric testing methods for which there is no general reliable distributional theory. Moreover, component selection is carried out in one single step as opposed to many selection procedures which involve an exhaustive search of all possible models. The empirical performance of the proposed methods is compared to that of some available techniques via an extensive simulation study. The results show under which conditions one method can be preferred over another, hence providing applied researchers with some practical guidelines.

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Vector-borne disease control relies on efficient vector surveillance, mostly carried out using traps whose number and locations are often determined by expert opinion rather than a rigorous quantitative sampling design. In this work we propose a framework for ecological sampling design which in its preliminary stages can take into account environmental conditions obtained from open data (i.e. remote sensing and meteorological stations) not necessarily designed for ecological analysis. These environmental data are used to delimit the area into ecologically homogeneous strata. By employing Bayesian statistics within a model-based sampling design, the traps are deployed among the strata using a mixture of random and grid locations which allows balancing predictions and model-fitting accuracies. Sample sizes and the effect of ecological strata on sample sizes are estimated from previous mosquito sampling campaigns open data. Notably, we found that a configuration of 30 locations with four households each (120 samples) will have a similar accuracy in the predictions of mosquito abundance as 200 random samples. In addition, we show that random sampling independently from ecological strata, produces biased estimates of the mosquito abundance. Finally, we propose standardizing reporting of sampling designs to allow transparency and repetition/re-use in subsequent sampling campaigns.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

The degree of spatial aggregation of female A. gambiae in each village was similar to its corresponding temporal aggregation, indicating that in designing sampling routines for estimating the abundance of mosquitoes, sampling effort should be allocated equally to houses (spatial) and nights (temporal). The analysis also showed that for a given amount of sampling effort, estimates of village-level mosquito abundance are more precise when sampling is carried out in randomly selected houses, than when the same houses are used on each sampling occasion. Also, the precision of estimating parous rates does not depend on whether mosquito sampling is carried out in the same or a random selection of houses.

abstract = {Background: Poisson regression modeling has been widely used to estimate influenza-associated disease burden, as it has the advantage of adjusting for multiple seasonal confounders. However, few studies have discussed how to judge the adequacy of confounding adjustment. This study aims to compare the performance of commonly adopted model selection criteria in terms of providing a reliable and valid estimate for the health impact of influenza. Methods: We assessed four model selection criteria: quasi Akaike information criterion (QAIC), quasi Bayesian information criterion (QBIC), partial autocorrelation functions of residuals (PACF), and generalized cross-validation (GCV), by separately applying them to select the Poisson model best fitted to the mortality datasets that were simulated under the different assumptions of seasonal confounding. The performance of these criteria was evaluated by the bias and root-mean-square error (RMSE) of estimates from the pre-determined coefficients of influenza proxy variable. These four criteria were subsequently applied to an empirical hospitalization dataset to confirm the findings of simulation study. Results: GCV consistently provided smaller biases and RMSEs for the influenza coefficient estimates than QAIC, QBIC and PACF, under the different simulation scenarios. Sensitivity analysis of different pre-determined influenza coefficients, study periods and lag weeks showed that GCV consistently outperformed the other criteria. Similar results were found in applying these selection criteria to estimate influenza-associated hospitalization. Conclusions: GCV criterion is recommended for selection of Poisson models to estimate influenza-associated mortality and morbidity burden with proper adjustment for confounding. These findings shall help standardize the Poisson modeling approach for influenza disease burden studies. {\textcopyright} 2012 Wang et al.},

abstract = {The problem of testing smooth components of an extended generalized additive model for equality to zero is considered. Confidence intervals for such components exhibit good across-the-function coverage probabilities if based on the approximate result, where f is the vector of evaluated values for the smooth component of interest and V f is the covariance matrix for f according to the Bayesian view of the smoothing process. Based on this result, a Wald-type test of f=0 is proposed. It is shown that care must be taken in selecting the rank used in the test statistic. The method complements previous work by extending applicability beyond the Gaussian case, while considering tests of zero effect rather than testing the parametric hypothesis given by the null space of the component's smoothing penalty. The proposed p-values are routine and efficient to compute from a fitted model, without requiring extra model fits or null distribution simulation. {\textcopyright} 2012 Biometrika Trust.},

abstract = {A budget proposal to stop the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) funding in surveillance and research for mosquito-borne diseases such as dengue and West Nile virus has the potential to leave the country illprepared to handle new emerging diseases and manage existing ones. In order to demonstrate the consequences of such a measure, if implemented, we evaluated the impact of delayed control responses to dengue epidemics (a likely scenario emerging from the proposed CDC budget cut) in an economically developed urban environment. We used a mathematical model to generate hypothetical scenarios of delayed response to a dengue introduction (a consequence of halted mosquito surveillance) in the City of Cairns, Queensland, Australia. We then coupled the results of such a model with mosquito surveillance and case management costs to estimate the cumulative costs of each response scenario. Our study shows that halting mosquito surveillance can increase the management costs of epidemics by up to an order of magnitude in comparison to a strategy with sustained surveillance and early case detection. Our analysis shows that the total costs of preparedness through surveillance are far lower than the ones needed to respond to the introduction of vector-borne pathogens, even without consideration of the cost in human lives and well-being. More specifically, our findings provide a science-based justification for the re-assessment of the current proposal to slash the budget of the CDC vector-borne diseases program, and emphasize the need for improved and sustainable systems for vector-borne disease surveillance. {\textcopyright} 2010 Vazquez-Prokopec et al.},

In addition, we asked whether synchrony, that is, the degree of concerted fluctuations in mosquito abundance across locations, was affected by the temperature gradient. We found the association of mosquito abundance with temperature to be delayed by 2 wk in the north when compared with the south. The abundance across all our sampling locations had a flat synchrony profile that could reflect impacts of rainfall and average temperature on the average of all our samples. Finally, our results showed that population synchrony across space can emerge even when abundance is differentially impacted by an exogenous factor across an environmental gradient.},

abstract = {We evaluated a hypothesis on the existence of two ecological groups of mosquito larvae. One group inhabits bodies of water on the ground, such as ponds, ditches and marshes, and exhibits fast development and a limited ability to prolong development under feeding stress. The other group inhabits small containers such as leaf axils of plants, treeholes and man-made containers, and exhibits slower development and the ability to prolong immature development under feeding stress. We measured development time in larvae of 14 species of mosquitoes and resistance to starvation in 22 species of mosquitoes from Venezuela. They inhabited structures of six species of plants (phytotelmata), one type of artificial container, and two ground-water habitats. The ground-water mosquito larvae (from temporary and permanent pools) exhibited the fastest development and lowest resistance to starvation, as predicted. The phytotelm mosquitoes exhibited the slowest development and greatest resistance to starvation, with some exceptions. Mosquitoes that colonize plant structures late in succession showed a lesser resistance to starvation than those that colonize during early succession. In man-made containers, mosquito species originally from phytotelmata [e.g. Aedes aegypti (L.)] showed greater resistance to starvation than did mosquito species originally from ground-water habitats (e.g. Culex quinquefasciatus Say), however development times for the two groups were similar. Rather than two discrete groups of mosquitoes, there is a diversity of traits related to selective pressures operating in the diverse aquatic habitats of the mosquito larvae. {\textcopyright} 1996 Taylor {\&} Francis Group, LLC.},

Twelve species of mosquitoes (Aedes vexans, Anopheles barberi, An. punctipennis, An. perplexens, Culex pipiens pipiens, Cx. restuans, Cx. salinarius, Cx. territans, Toxorhynchites rutilus septentrionalis, Ochlerotatus atropalpus, Oc. japonicus japonicus, and Oc. triseriatus) were collected from 8 New York state dairy farms in 2001 and from 17 dairy farms in 2002. All but 2 of these species have been found naturally infected with arboviruses and could be important vectors affecting human and animal health. Because of the potential public and animal health importance of the invasive species Oc. j. japonicus, active surveillance to identify breeding sites and distribution of this mosquito is essential. In 2001, Oc. j. japonicus was recovered from 5 of 8 central New York dairy farms surveyed. In 2002, Oc. j. japonicus was recovered from 4 of the same dairy farms plus an additional dairy out of 5 surveyed. This species appears to be established on dairy farms in the south, central, and eastern regions of New York state, with greatest abundance in the southeastern region. A single Oc. j. japonicus larva was collected from the northern region on the final sampling date in September 2002. Our data demonstrate that agricultural tire habitats can be productive breeding sites for arbovirus vectors. As a consequence, these habitats should not be ignored in vector control and surveillance programs.},

@article{Holloway2018,
abstract = {Insect pests now pose a greater threat to crop production given the recent emergence of insecticide resistance, the removal of effective compounds from the market (e.g. neonicotinoids) and the changing climate that promotes successful overwintering and earlier migration of pests. As surveillance tools, predictive models are important to mitigate against pest outbreaks. Currently they provide decision support on species emergence, distribution, and migration patterns and their use effectively gives growers more time to take strategic crop interventions such as delayed sowing or targeted insecticide use. Existing techniques may have met their optimal usefulness, particularly in complex systems and changing climates. Machine learning (ML) arguably is an advance over current capabilities because it has the potential to efficiently identify the most informative time-windows whilst simultaneously improving species predictions. In doing so, ML is likely to advance the length of any integrated pest management opportunity when growers can intervene. As an example, we studied the migration of 51 species of aphids, which include some of the most economically important pests worldwide. We used a combination of entropy and C5.0 boosted decision trees to identify the most informative time windows to link meteorological variables to aphid migration patterns across the UK. Decision trees significantly improved the accuracy of first flight prediction by 20{\%} compared to general additive models; further, meteorological variables that were selected by entropy significantly improved the accuracy by a further 3â5{\%} compared to expert derived variables. Coarser (e.g. monthly) weather variables resulted in similar accuracies to finer (e.g. daily) variables but the most accurate model included multiple temporal resolutions with different period lengths. This combined resolution model alone highlights the ability of machine learning to accurately predict complex relationships between species and their meteorological drivers, largely beyond the experience of experts in the field. Finally, we identified the potential of these models to predict long-term first flight patterns in which machine learning attained equally high predictive ability as shorter-term forecasts. Whilst machine learning is a statistical advance, it is not necessarily a panacea: experts will be needed to underpin results with a mechanistic understanding, thus avoiding spurious relationships. The results of this study should provide researchers with an automated methodology to derive and select the most appropriate environmental variables when predicting ecological phenomena, while simultaneously improving the accuracy of such models.},

abstract = {Mosquito-borne diseases cause a major burden of disease worldwide. The vital rates of these ectothermic vectors and parasites respond strongly and nonlinearly to temperature and therefore to climate change. Here, we review how trait-based approaches can synthesise and mechanistically predict the temperature dependence of transmission across vectors, pathogens, and environments. We present 11 pathogens transmitted by 15 different mosquito species â including globally important diseases like malaria, dengue, and Zika â synthesised from previously published studies. Transmission varied strongly and unimodally with temperature, peaking at 23â29{\textordmasculine}C and declining to zero below 9â23{\textordmasculine}C and above 32â38{\textordmasculine}C. Different traits restricted transmission at low versus high temperatures, and temperature effects on transmission varied by both mosquito and parasite species. Temperate pathogens exhibit broader thermal ranges and cooler thermal minima and optima than tropical pathogens. Among tropical pathogens, malaria and Ross River virus had lower thermal optima (25â26{\textordmasculine}C) while dengue and Zika viruses had the highest (29{\textordmasculine}C)Â thermal optima. We expect warming to increase transmission below thermal optima but decrease transmission above optima. Key directions for future work include linking mechanistic models to field transmission, combining temperature effects with control measures, incorporating trait variation and temperature variation, and investigating climate adaptation and migration.},

abstract = {Background. Immature stages of the malaria mosquito Anopheles gambiae experience high mortality, but its cause is poorly undestood. Here we study the impact of rainfall, one of the abiotic factors to which the immatures are frequently exposed, on their mortality. Methodology/Principal Findings. We show that rainfall significantly affected larval mosquitoes by flushing them out of their aquatic habitat and killing them. Outdoor experiments under natural conditions in Kenya revealed that the additional nightly loss of larvae caused by rainfall was on average 17.5{\%} for the youngest (L1) larvae and 4.8{\%} for the oldest (L4) larvae; an additional 10.5{\%} (increase from 0.9 to 11.4{\%}) of the L1 larvae and 3.3{\%} (from 0.1 to 3.4{\%}) of the L4 larvae were flushed away and larval mortality increased by 6.9{\%} (from 4.6 to 11.5{\%}) and 1.5{\%} (from 4.1 to 5.6{\%}) for L1 and L4 larvae, respectively, compared to nights without rain. On rainy nights, 1.3{\%} and 0.7{\%} of L1 and L4 larvae, respectively, were lost due to ejection from the breeding site. Conclusions/Significance. This study demonstrates that immature populations of malaria mosquitoes suffer high losses during rainfall events. As these populations are likely to experience several ralin showers during their lifespan, rainfall will have a profound effect on the productivity of mosquito breeding sites and, as a result, on the transmission of malaria. These findings are discussed in the light of malaria risk and changing rainfall patterns in response to climate change. {\textcopyright} 2007 Paaijmans et al.},

Rather than the traditional null hypothesis testing approach, they have adopted an approach called model selection, in which several competing hypotheses are simultaneously confronted with data. Model selection can be used to identify a single best model, thus lending support to one particular hypothesis, or it can be used to make inferences based on weighted support from a complete set of competing models. Model selection is widely accepted and well developed in certain fields, most notably in molecular systematics and markârecapture analysis. However, it is now gaining support in several other areas, from molecular evolution to landscape ecology. Here, we outline the steps of model selection and highlight several ways that it is now being implemented. By adopting this approach, researchers in ecology and evolution will find a valuable alternative to traditional null hypothesis testing, especially when more than one hypothesis is plausible.},

abstract = {Global warming has advanced the timing of biological events, potentially leading to disruption across trophic levels. The potential importance of phenological change as a driver of population trends has been suggested. To fully understand the possible impacts, there is a need to quantify the scale of these changes spatially and according to habitat type. We studied the relationship between phenological trends, space and habitat type between 1965 and 2012 using an extensive UK dataset comprising 269 aphid, bird, butterfly and moth species. We modelled phenologies using generalized additive mixed models that included covariates for geographical (latitude, longitude, altitude), temporal (year, season) and habitat terms (woodland, scrub, grassland). Model selection showed that a baseline model with geographical and temporal components explained the variation in phenologies better than either a model in which space and time interacted or a habitat model without spatial terms. This baseline model showed strongly that phenologies shifted progressively earlier over time, that increasing altitude produced later phenologies and that a strong spatial component determined phenological timings, particularly latitude. The seasonal timing of a phenological event, in terms of whether it fell in the first or second half of the year, did not result in substantially different trends for butterflies. For moths, early season phenologies advanced more rapidly than those recorded later. Whilst temporal trends across all habitats resulted in earlier phenologies over time, agricultural habitats produced significantly later phenologies than most other habitats studied, probably because of nonclimatic drivers. A model with a significant habitat-time interaction was the best-fitting model for birds, moths and butterflies, emphasizing that the rates of phenological advance also differ among habitats for these groups. Our results suggest the presence of strong spatial gradients in mean seasonal timing and nonlinear trends towards earlier seasonal timing that varies in form and rate among habitat types.},

abstract = {Background: The surveillance of vector mosquitoes is important for the control of mosquito-borne diseases. To identify a suitable surveillance tool for the adult dengue vector Aedes albopictus, the efficacy of the BG-Sentinel trap, CDC light trap and Mosquito-oviposition trap (MOT) on the capture of vector mosquitoes were comparatively evaluated in this study. Methods: The capture efficiencies of the BG-Sentinel trap, CDC light trap and Mosquito-oviposition trap for common vector mosquitoes were tested in a laboratory setting, through the release-recapture method, and at two field sites of Guangzhou, China from June 2013 to May 2014. The captured mosquitoes were counted, species identified and compared among the three traps on the basis of species. Results: In the release-recapture experiments in a laboratory setting, the BG-Sentinel trap caught significantly more Aedes albopictus and Culex quinquefasciatus than the CDC light trap and Mosquito-ovitrap, except for Anopheles sinensis. The BG-Sentinel trap had a higher efficacy in capturing female rather than male Ae. albopictus and Cx. quinquefasciatus, but the capture in CDC light traps displayed no significant differences. In the field trial, BG-Sentinel traps collected more Aedes albopictus than CDC light traps and MOTs collected in both urban and suburban areas. The BG-Sentinel trap was more sensitive for monitoring the population density of Aedes albopictus than the CDC light trap and MOT during the peak months of the year 2013. However, on an average, CDC light traps captured significantly more Cx. quinquefasciatus than BG-Sentinel traps. The population dynamics of Cx. quinquefasciatus displayed a significant seasonal variation, with the lowest numbers in the middle of the year. Conclusions: This study indicates that the BG-Sentinel trap is more effective than the commonly used CDC light trap and MOT in sampling adult Aedes albopictus and Culex quinquefasciatus. We recommend its use in the surveillance of dengue vector mosquitoes in China.},

abstract = {The transmission of mosquito-borne diseases is strongly linked to the abundance of the host vector. Identifying the environmental and biological precursors which herald the onset of peaks in mosquito abundance would give health and land-use managers the capacity to predict the timing and distribution of the most efficient and cost-effective mosquito control. We analysed a 15-year time series of monthly abundance of Aedes vigilax, a tropical mosquito species from northern Australia, to determine periodicity and drivers of population peaks (high-density outbreaks). Two sets of density-dependent models were used to examine the correlation between mosquito abundance peaks and the environmental drivers of peaks or troughs (low-density periods). The seasonal peaks of reproduction (r) and abundance (Npeak) occur at the beginning of September and early November, respectively. The combination of low mosquito abundance and a low frequency of a high tide exceeding 7 m in the previous low-abundance (trough) period were the most parsimonious predictors of a peak's magnitude, with this model explaining over 50{\%} of the deviance in Npeak. Model weights, estimated using AICc, were also relatively high for those including monthly maximum tide height, monthly accumulated tide height or total rainfall per month in the trough, with high values in the trough correlating negatively with the onset of a high-abundance peak. These findings illustrate that basic environmental monitoring data can be coupled with relatively simple density feedback models to predict the timing and magnitude of mosquito abundance peaks. Decision-makers can use these methods to determine optimal levels of control (i.e., least-cost measures yielding the largest decline in mosquito abundance) and so reduce the risk of disease outbreaks in human populations. {\textcopyright} 2009 Yang et al.},

When the data to which the GAM are being applied have two characteristics - 1) the estimated regression coefficients are small and 2) there exist confounding factors that are modeled using at least two nonparametric smooth functions - the default settings in the gam function of the S-Plus software package (version 3.4) do not assure convergence of its iterative estimation procedure and can provide biased estimates of regression coefficients and standard errors. This phenomenon has occurred in time-series analyses of contemporary data on air pollution and mortality. To evaluate the impact of default implementation of the gam software on published analyses, the authors reanalyzed data from the National Morbidity, Mortality, and Air Pollution Study (NMMAPS) using three different methods: 1) Poisson regression with parametric nonlinear adjustments for confounding factors; 2) GAM with default convergence parameters; and 3) GAM with more stringent convergence parameters than the default settings. The authors found that pooled NMMAPS estimates were very similar under the first and third methods but were biased upward under the second method.},

However, MAPE has the significant disadvantage that it produces infinite or undefined values for zero or close-to-zero actual values. In order to address this issue in MAPE, we propose a new measure of forecast accuracy called the mean arctangent absolute percentage error (MAAPE). MAAPE has been developed through looking at MAPE from a different angle. In essence, MAAPE is a slope as an angle, while MAPE is a slope as a ratio, considering a triangle with adjacent and opposite sides that are equal to an actual value and the difference between the actual and forecast values, respectively. MAAPE inherently preserves the philosophy of MAPE, overcoming the problem of division by zero by using bounded influences for outliers in a fundamental manner through considering the ratio as an angle instead of a slope. The theoretical properties of MAAPE are investigated, and the practical advantages are demonstrated using both simulated and real-life data.},

abstract = {Background: The impact of climate change on vector-borne diseases is highly controversial. One of the principal points of debate is whether or not climate influences mosquito abundance, a key factor in disease transmission. Methods. To test this hypothesis, we analysed ten years of data (2003-2012) from biweekly surveys to assess inter-annual and seasonal relationships between the abundance of seven mosquito species known to be pathogen vectors (West Nile virus, Usutu virus, dirofilariasis and Plasmodium sp.) and several climatic variables in two wetlands in SW Spain. Results: Within-season abundance patterns were related to climatic variables (i.e. temperature, rainfall, tide heights, relative humidity and photoperiod) that varied according to the mosquito species in question. Rainfall during winter months was positively related to Culex pipiens and Ochlerotatus detritus annual abundances. Annual maximum temperatures were non-linearly related to annual Cx. pipiens abundance, while annual mean temperatures were positively related to annual Ochlerotatus caspius abundance. Finally, we modelled shifts in mosquito abundances using the A2 and B2 temperature and rainfall climate change scenarios for the period 2011-2100. While Oc. caspius, an important anthropophilic species, may increase in abundance, no changes are expected for Cx. pipiens or the salt-marsh mosquito Oc. detritus. Conclusions: Our results highlight that the effects of climate are species-specific, place-specific and non-linear and that linear approaches will therefore overestimate the effect of climate change on mosquito abundances at high temperatures. Climate warming does not necessarily lead to an increase in mosquito abundance in natural Mediterranean wetlands and will affect, above all, species such as Oc. caspius whose numbers are not closely linked to rainfall and are influenced, rather, by local tidal patterns and temperatures. The final impact of changes in vector abundance on disease frequency will depend on the direct and indirect effects of climate and other parameters related to pathogen amplification and spillover on humans and other vertebrates. {\textcopyright} 2014 Roiz et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract = {This article discusses a general framework for smoothing parameter estimation for models with regular likelihoods constructed in terms of unknown smooth functions of covariates. Gaussian random effects and parametric terms may also be present. By construction the method is numerically stable and convergent, and enables smoothing parameter uncertainty to be quantified. The latter enables us to fix a well known problem with AIC for such models, thereby improving the range of model selection tools available. The smooth functions are represented by reduced rank spline like smoothers, with associated quadratic penalties measuring function smoothness. Model estimation is by penalized likelihood maximization, where the smoothing parameters controlling the extent of penalization are estimated by Laplace approximate marginal likelihood. The methods cover, for example, generalized additive models for nonexponential family responses (e.g., beta, ordered categorical, scaled t distribution, negative binomial and Tweedie distributions), generalized additive models for location scale and shape (e.g., two stage zero inflation models, and Gaussian location-scale models), Cox proportional hazards models and multivariate additive models. The framework reduces the implementation of new model classes to the coding of some standard derivatives of the log-likelihood. Supplementary materials for this article are available online.},

In general, models for early warning systems only consider average environmental conditions ignoring variation in weather variables, despite the prediction from Schmalhausen's law about the importance of environmental variability for biological systems. We present results from a long-term mosquito surveillance program from Harris County, Texas, USA, where we use time series analysis techniques to study the abundance and West Nile virus (WNV) infection patterns in the local primary vector, Culex quinquefasciatus Say. We found that, as predicted by Schmalhausen's law, mosquito abundance was associated with the standard deviation and kurtosis of environmental variables. By contrast, WNV infection rates were associated with 8-month lagged temperature, suggesting environmental conditions during overwintering might be key for WNV amplification during summer outbreaks. Finally, model validation showed that seasonal autoregressive models successfully predicted mosquito WNV infection rates up to 2 months ahead, but did rather poorly at predicting mosquito abundance, a result that might reflect impacts of vector control for mosquito population reduction, geographic scale, and other artifacts generated by operational constraints of mosquito surveillance systems.},

abstract = {Although we have known anecdotally that insects have been declining in Great Britain for more than 100 years, insect declines have only been statistically estimated over the last 20 years. Estimation of the rate of those declines is still hotly debated, fuelled by a lack of standardised, systematically collected data. More than 24 million individual moths and aphids collected from 112 light traps and 25 12.2 m suction-traps, respectively, were analysed using mixed models. Our objective was to estimate the long-term trends in both groups based on annual totals recorded every year between 1969 and 2016. The models showed that two paradigms existed: Over 47 years, long-term linear trends showed that moths had declined significantly by â31{\%}, but short-term trends indicated that there were periods of significant decline and recovery in most decades since the 1960s. Conversely, despite aphid annual totals fluctuating widely, this group was in a steady state over the long-term, with a non-significant decline of â7.6{\%}. Sensitivity analysis revealed that moth trends were not driven by a group of abundant species, but the sign of the overall aphid trends may have been driven by three of the most abundant species. The spatial extent of moth trends suggests that they are extremely heterogeneous. Uniquely, moth declines were different among several habitat types, with robust significant declines found in coastal, urban and woodland habitats, but notably not in agricultural, parkland and scrubland habitats. Conversely, aphid trends showed spatial synchrony extending to 338 km, albeit with local variation.},

-Trait variance affects population dynamics of vectors

2 ways trait variation changes transmission dynamics:
1.) Changes vector abundances on similar time scales as the pathogen dynamics
2.) Directly changes transmission potential of the pathogen

-Inclusion of trait variation into VBD models will make models more mechanistic and allow for prediction at longer/larger temporal/spatial scales

- we lack basic trait data

- lack a model that would allow for the inclusion of this mechanistic parameter

3 Types of trait variation:
1. Variation across individual's lifespan 
- end of life trait values are more likely to contribute to transmission: older individuals are more likely to be infected due to more likely exposure and more likely to have survive extrinsic incubation period (EIP). Also more likely to transmit because they are more likely to have bitten more hosts after becoming infectious. Trait values can be specific to certain life stages

2. Within-Population Variation:
Subgroups can have different transmission related traits and disproportionately affect total pop transmission/fitness potential

3. Environmentally driven variation
temperature and humidity drives vector life history and competence. Other things possible but temp is most studied

Models need to also account for relationships BETWEEN traits

CURRENT APPROACHES (3)
1. SIR Compartment Model: Ross-Macdonald Model that includes transmission parameters. Assumes vectors are homogeneous "flying syringes". See Smith et al 2012 for model

2. Compartment Models with some population dynamics- includes extra parameters but does not allow for trait variation, covraiance, or trait variance as a driver of population dynamics

3. Compartment + Population Dynamics + Trait Variation + Anderson-May models
Inclusion of trait variation does have effect of predicted R0

Mechanistic vs Phenomenological
Mechanistic: include trait variation of r (bird, death, fecundity at different life stages) into model: shows 2 peaks of R0

Phenomenological:
time-series model or abundance assumed to follow sinusoidal function- shows R0 tracking temperature variation with some time lag- 1 peak of R0. Particularly weak model when variation is on shorter timescale than pathogen transmission rate

Goal: Create a trait-based VBD modelling approach that incorporates both trait variation and population dynamics

Framework:
i. Trait -{\textgreater} Parameter
ii. Trait-Variation -{\textgreater} Fitness
iii. Fitness -{\textgreater} Population Dynamics
iv. Population Dynamics -{\textgreater} Disease Dynamics

Challenges (4):
- data- how to prioritize experiments and report data
- parameterization: how to link model components to data
- model selection and validation},

@article{Jian2014,
abstract = {An improved understanding of mosquito population dynamics under natural environmental forcing requires adequate field observations spanning the full range of temporal scales over which mosquito abundance fluctuates in natural conditions. Here we analyze a 9-year daily time series of uninterrupted observations of adult mosquito abundance for multiple mosquito species in North Carolina to identify characteristic scales of temporal variability, the processes generating them, and the representativeness of observations at different sampling resolutions. We focus in particular on Aedes vexans and Culiseta melanura and, using a combination of spectral analysis and modeling, we find significant population fluctuations with characteristic periodicity between 2 days and several years. Population dynamical modelling suggests that the observed fast fluctuations scales (2 days-weeks) are importantly affected by a varying mosquito activity in response to rapid changes in meteorological conditions, a process neglected in most representations of mosquito population dynamics. We further suggest that the range of time scales over which adult mosquito population variability takes place can be divided into three main parts. At small time scales (indicatively 2 days-1 month) observed population fluctuations are mainly driven by behavioral responses to rapid changes in weather conditions. At intermediate scales (1 to several month) environmentally-forced fluctuations in generation times, mortality rates, and density dependence determine the population characteristic response times. At longer scales (annual to multiannual) mosquito populations follow seasonal and inter-annual environmental changes. We conclude that observations of adult mosquito populations should be based on a sub-weekly sampling frequency and that predictive models of mosquito abundance must include behavioral dynamics to separate the effects of a varying mosquito activity from actual changes in the abundance of the underlying population.

abstract = {Arguably one of the most important effects of climate change is the potential impact on human health. While this is likely to take many forms, the implications for future transmission of vector-borne diseases (VBDs), given their ongoing contribution to global disease burden, are both extremely important and highly uncertain. In part, this is owing not only to data limitations and methodological challenges when integrating climate-driven VBD models and climate change projections, but also, perhaps most crucially, to the multitude of epidemiological, ecological and socio-economic factors that drive VBD transmission, and this complexity has generated considerable debate over the past 10â15 years. In this review, we seek to elucidate current knowledge around this topic, identify key themes and uncertainties, evaluate ongoing challenges and open research questions and, crucially, offer some solutions for the field. Although many of these challenges are ubiquitous across multiple VBDs, more specific issues also arise in different vectorâpathogen systems.},
