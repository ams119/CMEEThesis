abstract = {The parasites that cause malaria depend on Anopheles mosquitoes for transmission; because of this, mosquito population dynamics are a key determinant of malaria risk. Development and survival rates of both the Anopheles mosquitoes and the Plasmodium parasites that cause malaria depend on temperature, making this a potential driver of mosquito population dynamics and malaria transmission. We developed a temperature-dependent, stage-structured delayed differential equation model to better understand how climate determines risk. Including the full mosquito life cycle in the model reveals that the mosquito population abundance is more sensitive to temperature than previously thought because it is strongly influenced by the dynamics of the juvenile mosquito stages whose vital rates are also temperature-dependent. Additionally, the model predicts a peak in abundance of mosquitoes old enough to vector malaria at more accurate temperatures than previous models. Our results point to the importance of incorporating detailed vector biology into models for predicting the risk for vector borne diseases. {\textcopyright} 2013 Beck-Johnson et al.},

abstract = {Seasonal changes in the abundance of exothermic organisms can be expected with climate change if warmer temperatures can induce changes in their phenology. Given the increased time for ectothermic organism development at lower temperatures, we asked whether population dynamics of the house mosquito, Culex pipiens s.l. (L.) (Diptera: Culicidae), in Jeju-do (South Korea), an island with a gradient of warming temperatures from north to south, showed differences in sensitivity to changes in temperature along the warming gradient. In addition, we asked whether synchrony, that is, the degree of concerted fluctuations in mosquito abundance across locations, was affected by the temperature gradient. We found the association of mosquito abundance with temperature to be delayed by 2 wk in the north when compared with the south. The abundance across all our sampling locations had a flat synchrony profile that could reflect impacts of rainfall and average temperature on the average of all our samples. Finally, our results showed that population synchrony across space can emerge even when abundance is differentially impacted by an exogenous factor across an environmental gradient.},

abstract = {Although we have known anecdotally that insects have been declining in Great Britain for more than 100 years, insect declines have only been statistically estimated over the last 20 years. Estimation of the rate of those declines is still hotly debated, fuelled by a lack of standardised, systematically collected data. More than 24 million individual moths and aphids collected from 112 light traps and 25 12.2 m suction-traps, respectively, were analysed using mixed models. Our objective was to estimate the long-term trends in both groups based on annual totals recorded every year between 1969 and 2016. The models showed that two paradigms existed: Over 47 years, long-term linear trends showed that moths had declined significantly by −31{\%}, but short-term trends indicated that there were periods of significant decline and recovery in most decades since the 1960s. Conversely, despite aphid annual totals fluctuating widely, this group was in a steady state over the long-term, with a non-significant decline of −7.6{\%}. Sensitivity analysis revealed that moth trends were not driven by a group of abundant species, but the sign of the overall aphid trends may have been driven by three of the most abundant species. The spatial extent of moth trends suggests that they are extremely heterogeneous. Uniquely, moth declines were different among several habitat types, with robust significant declines found in coastal, urban and woodland habitats, but notably not in agricultural, parkland and scrubland habitats. Conversely, aphid trends showed spatial synchrony extending to 338 km, albeit with local variation.},

The iterative thresholding reduces the effect of information loss associated with image binarization.

abstract = {Global warming has advanced the timing of biological events, potentially leading to disruption across trophic levels. The potential importance of phenological change as a driver of population trends has been suggested. To fully understand the possible impacts, there is a need to quantify the scale of these changes spatially and according to habitat type. We studied the relationship between phenological trends, space and habitat type between 1965 and 2012 using an extensive UK dataset comprising 269 aphid, bird, butterfly and moth species. We modelled phenologies using generalized additive mixed models that included covariates for geographical (latitude, longitude, altitude), temporal (year, season) and habitat terms (woodland, scrub, grassland). Model selection showed that a baseline model with geographical and temporal components explained the variation in phenologies better than either a model in which space and time interacted or a habitat model without spatial terms. This baseline model showed strongly that phenologies shifted progressively earlier over time, that increasing altitude produced later phenologies and that a strong spatial component determined phenological timings, particularly latitude. The seasonal timing of a phenological event, in terms of whether it fell in the first or second half of the year, did not result in substantially different trends for butterflies. For moths, early season phenologies advanced more rapidly than those recorded later. Whilst temporal trends across all habitats resulted in earlier phenologies over time, agricultural habitats produced significantly later phenologies than most other habitats studied, probably because of nonclimatic drivers. A model with a significant habitat-time interaction was the best-fitting model for birds, moths and butterflies, emphasizing that the rates of phenological advance also differ among habitats for these groups. Our results suggest the presence of strong spatial gradients in mean seasonal timing and nonlinear trends towards earlier seasonal timing that varies in form and rate among habitat types.},

Mosquito abundance is a key determinant of outbreaks of mosquito-borne diseases, such as West Nile virus (WNV). In this work, the short-term impact of weather conditions (temperature and precipitation) on Culex pipiens L.-Culex restuans Theobald mosquito abundance in Peel Region, Ontario, Canada, was investigated using the 2002-2009 mosquito data collected from the WNV surveillance program managed by Ontario Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care and a gamma-generalized linear model. There was a clear association between weather conditions (temperature and precipitation) and mosquito abundance, which allowed the definition of threshold criteria for temperature and precipitation conditions for mosquito population growth. A predictive statistical model for mosquito population based on weather conditions was calibrated using real weather and mosquito surveillance data, and validated using a subset of surveillance data. Results showed that WNV vector abundance on any one day could be predicted with reasonable accuracy from relationships with mean degree-days {\textgreater}9°C over the 11 preceding days, and precipitation 35 d previously. This finding provides optimism for the development of weather-generated forecasting for WNV risk that could be used in decision support systems for interventions such as mosquito control. {\textcopyright} 2011 Entomological Society of America.},

In general, models for early warning systems only consider average environmental conditions ignoring variation in weather variables, despite the prediction from Schmalhausen's law about the importance of environmental variability for biological systems. We present results from a long-term mosquito surveillance program from Harris County, Texas, USA, where we use time series analysis techniques to study the abundance and West Nile virus (WNV) infection patterns in the local primary vector, Culex quinquefasciatus Say. We found that, as predicted by Schmalhausen's law, mosquito abundance was associated with the standard deviation and kurtosis of environmental variables. By contrast, WNV infection rates were associated with 8-month lagged temperature, suggesting environmental conditions during overwintering might be key for WNV amplification during summer outbreaks. Finally, model validation showed that seasonal autoregressive models successfully predicted mosquito WNV infection rates up to 2 months ahead, but did rather poorly at predicting mosquito abundance, a result that might reflect impacts of vector control for mosquito population reduction, geographic scale, and other artifacts generated by operational constraints of mosquito surveillance systems.},

annote = {Intro:
-Trait variance affects population dynamics of vectors

2 ways trait variation changes transmission dynamics:
1.) Changes vector abundances on similar time scales as the pathogen dynamics
2.) Directly changes transmission potential of the pathogen

-Inclusion of trait variation into VBD models will make models more mechanistic and allow for prediction at longer/larger temporal/spatial scales

- we lack basic trait data

- lack a model that would allow for the inclusion of this mechanistic parameter

3 Types of trait variation:
1. Variation across individual's lifespan 
- end of life trait values are more likely to contribute to transmission: older individuals are more likely to be infected due to more likely exposure and more likely to have survive extrinsic incubation period (EIP). Also more likely to transmit because they are more likely to have bitten more hosts after becoming infectious. Trait values can be specific to certain life stages

2. Within-Population Variation:
Subgroups can have different transmission related traits and disproportionately affect total pop transmission/fitness potential

3. Environmentally driven variation
temperature and humidity drives vector life history and competence. Other things possible but temp is most studied

Models need to also account for relationships BETWEEN traits

CURRENT APPROACHES (3)
1. SIR Compartment Model: Ross-Macdonald Model that includes transmission parameters. Assumes vectors are homogeneous "flying syringes". See Smith et al 2012 for model

2. Compartment Models with some population dynamics- includes extra parameters but does not allow for trait variation, covraiance, or trait variance as a driver of population dynamics

3. Compartment + Population Dynamics + Trait Variation + Anderson-May models
Inclusion of trait variation does have effect of predicted R0

Mechanistic vs Phenomenological
Mechanistic: include trait variation of r (bird, death, fecundity at different life stages) into model: shows 2 peaks of R0

Phenomenological:
time-series model or abundance assumed to follow sinusoidal function- shows R0 tracking temperature variation with some time lag- 1 peak of R0. Particularly weak model when variation is on shorter timescale than pathogen transmission rate

Goal: Create a trait-based VBD modelling approach that incorporates both trait variation and population dynamics

Framework:
i. Trait -{\textgreater} Parameter
ii. Trait-Variation -{\textgreater} Fitness
iii. Fitness -{\textgreater} Population Dynamics
iv. Population Dynamics -{\textgreater} Disease Dynamics

Challenges (4):
- data- how to prioritize experiments and report data
- parameterization: how to link model components to data
- model selection and validation},

The vital rates of these ectothermic vectors and parasites respond strongly and nonlinearly to temperature and therefore to climate change. Here, we review how trait-based approaches can synthesise and mechanistically predict the temperature dependence of transmission across vectors, pathogens, and environments. We present 11 pathogens transmitted by 15 different mosquito species – including globally important diseases like malaria, dengue, and Zika – synthesised from previously published studies. Transmission varied strongly and unimodally with temperature, peaking at 23–29{\textordmasculine}C and declining to zero below 9–23{\textordmasculine}C and above 32–38{\textordmasculine}C. Different traits restricted transmission at low versus high temperatures, and temperature effects on transmission varied by both mosquito and parasite species. Temperate pathogens exhibit broader thermal ranges and cooler thermal minima and optima than tropical pathogens. Among tropical pathogens, malaria and Ross River virus had lower thermal optima (25–26{\textordmasculine}C) while dengue and Zika viruses had the highest (29{\textordmasculine}C) thermal optima. We expect warming to increase transmission below thermal optima but decrease transmission above optima. Key directions for future work include linking mechanistic models to field transmission, combining temperature effects with control measures, incorporating trait variation and temperature variation, and investigating climate adaptation and migration.},

abstract = {Insect pests now pose a greater threat to crop production given the recent emergence of insecticide resistance, the removal of effective compounds from the market (e.g. neonicotinoids) and the changing climate that promotes successful overwintering and earlier migration of pests. As surveillance tools, predictive models are important to mitigate against pest outbreaks. Currently they provide decision support on species emergence, distribution, and migration patterns and their use effectively gives growers more time to take strategic crop interventions such as delayed sowing or targeted insecticide use. Existing techniques may have met their optimal usefulness, particularly in complex systems and changing climates. Machine learning (ML) arguably is an advance over current capabilities because it has the potential to efficiently identify the most informative time-windows whilst simultaneously improving species predictions. In doing so, ML is likely to advance the length of any integrated pest management opportunity when growers can intervene. As an example, we studied the migration of 51 species of aphids, which include some of the most economically important pests worldwide. We used a combination of entropy and C5.0 boosted decision trees to identify the most informative time windows to link meteorological variables to aphid migration patterns across the UK. Decision trees significantly improved the accuracy of first flight prediction by 20{\%} compared to general additive models; further, meteorological variables that were selected by entropy significantly improved the accuracy by a further 3–5{\%} compared to expert derived variables. Coarser (e.g. monthly) weather variables resulted in similar accuracies to finer (e.g. daily) variables but the most accurate model included multiple temporal resolutions with different period lengths. This combined resolution model alone highlights the ability of machine learning to accurately predict complex relationships between species and their meteorological drivers, largely beyond the experience of experts in the field. Finally, we identified the potential of these models to predict long-term first flight patterns in which machine learning attained equally high predictive ability as shorter-term forecasts. Whilst machine learning is a statistical advance, it is not necessarily a panacea: experts will be needed to underpin results with a mechanistic understanding, thus avoiding spurious relationships. The results of this study should provide researchers with an automated methodology to derive and select the most appropriate environmental variables when predicting ecological phenomena, while simultaneously improving the accuracy of such models.},

Based on the analysis of data on RRV disease rates between mosquito control types within 4 climatic regions, each region had different combinations of mosquito control strategies in their programs; there were also general similarities in the relationship between program types and RRV rates between the regions. The long-term RRV disease rates were lower in areas where the mosquito control program included pre-emptive (rather than reactive) surveillance based on an extensive (rather than incomplete) knowledge of mosquito habitats, and where treatment of both saltwater and freshwater habitats (compared to only saltwater habitats, in coastal areas) occurred. The data indicate that mosquito control is an effective public health intervention to reduce mosquito-borne disease; hence, climate change adaptation strategies should ensure that adequate resources are available for effective vector control so as to manage the risk of mosquito-borne diseases. {\textcopyright} 2011 by The American Mosquito Control Association, Inc.},

abstract = {Background: The impact of climate change on vector-borne diseases is highly controversial. One of the principal points of debate is whether or not climate influences mosquito abundance, a key factor in disease transmission. Methods. To test this hypothesis, we analysed ten years of data (2003-2012) from biweekly surveys to assess inter-annual and seasonal relationships between the abundance of seven mosquito species known to be pathogen vectors (West Nile virus, Usutu virus, dirofilariasis and Plasmodium sp.) and several climatic variables in two wetlands in SW Spain. Results: Within-season abundance patterns were related to climatic variables (i.e. temperature, rainfall, tide heights, relative humidity and photoperiod) that varied according to the mosquito species in question. Rainfall during winter months was positively related to Culex pipiens and Ochlerotatus detritus annual abundances. Annual maximum temperatures were non-linearly related to annual Cx. pipiens abundance, while annual mean temperatures were positively related to annual Ochlerotatus caspius abundance. Finally, we modelled shifts in mosquito abundances using the A2 and B2 temperature and rainfall climate change scenarios for the period 2011-2100. While Oc. caspius, an important anthropophilic species, may increase in abundance, no changes are expected for Cx. pipiens or the salt-marsh mosquito Oc. detritus. Conclusions: Our results highlight that the effects of climate are species-specific, place-specific and non-linear and that linear approaches will therefore overestimate the effect of climate change on mosquito abundances at high temperatures. Climate warming does not necessarily lead to an increase in mosquito abundance in natural Mediterranean wetlands and will affect, above all, species such as Oc. caspius whose numbers are not closely linked to rainfall and are influenced, rather, by local tidal patterns and temperatures. The final impact of changes in vector abundance on disease frequency will depend on the direct and indirect effects of climate and other parameters related to pathogen amplification and spillover on humans and other vertebrates. {\textcopyright} 2014 Roiz et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract = {Statistical methods for modelling plant species distributions are difficult to evaluate using field data because "truth" is unknown. Artificial data based on explicit theory can be used as "truth". Statistical models should be capable of recovering "truth" if they are to be useful when applied to field data. Use of artificial data in plant community ecology to evaluate statistical methods is reviewed. Two plant community theoretical models based on the continuum concept are identified for describing species responses, the Swan/ter Braak model (Gaussian symmetric unimodal responses) and the Ellenberg/Minchin model (skewed unimodal responses). Theory regarding both indirect and direct environmental gradients is used to simulate a realistic species/environment data set. The software package COMPAS with a restricted set of options is used to generate two types of data set: (1) direct, where species show typical responses to variables such as radiation and (2) indirect, where variables like aspect and slope which are related to radiation by complex environmental processes. An example of generalised linear models (GLM) and generalised additive models (GAM) applied to the artificial data sets by analysts unaware of truth is presented. The results are evaluated on the following criteria: correct selection of predictors; accurate description of response curves; prediction of abundance; and ecologically rational relationships. The potential impacts of differences in the skills of the analysts are discussed. Both GLM and GAM performed well with Gaussian responses and direct gradient predictors. GAM performed marginally better with the skewed response model and direct predictors. GAM performed consistently better than GLM with the indirect predictors. The main conclusion was that the ecological knowledge and statistical skills of the analysts were more important than the method used. Crown Copyright {\textcopyright} 2006.},

Nine chickens that ingested WNV-NY99 failed to become infected. The domestic chickens in this study were susceptible to WN virus infection, developed detectable antibodies, survived infection, and with one exception failed to infect cage mates.

abstract = {An empirical model to forecast West Nile virus mosquito vector populations is developed using time series analysis techniques. Specifically, multivariate seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) models were developed for Aedes vexans and the combined group of Culex pipiens and Culex restuans in Erie County, New York. Weekly mosquito collections data were obtained for the four mosquito seasons from 2002 to 2005 from the Erie County Department of Health, Vector and Pest Control Program. Climate variables were tested for significance with cross-correlation analysis. Minimum temperature (T min), maximum temperature (Tmax), average temperature (Tave), precipitation (P), relative humidity (RH), and evapotranspiration (ET) were acquired from the Northeast Regional Climate Center (NRCC) at Cornell University. Weekly averages or sums of climate variables were calculated from the daily data. Other climate indexes were calculated and were tested for significance with the mosquito population data, including cooling degree days base 60 degrees (CDD{\_}60), cooling degree days base 63 (CDD{\_}63), cooling degree days base 65 (C DD{\_}65), a ponding index (IP), and an interactive C DD{\_}65-precipitation variable (CDD{\_}65 × P week{\_}4). Ae. vexans were adequately modeled with a (2,1,1)(1,1,0)52 SARIMA model. The combined group of Culex pipiens-restuans were modeled with a (0,1,1)(1,1,0)52 SARIMA model. The most significant meteorological variables for forecasting Aedes vexans abundance was the interactive CDD{\_}65 × Pweek{\_}4 variable at a lag of two weeks, ET × ET at a lag of five weeks, and CDD{\_}65 × CDD{\_}65 at a lag of seven weeks.

abstract = {The transmission of mosquito-borne diseases is strongly linked to the abundance of the host vector. Identifying the environmental and biological precursors which herald the onset of peaks in mosquito abundance would give health and land-use managers the capacity to predict the timing and distribution of the most efficient and cost-effective mosquito control. We analysed a 15-year time series of monthly abundance of Aedes vigilax, a tropical mosquito species from northern Australia, to determine periodicity and drivers of population peaks (high-density outbreaks). Two sets of density-dependent models were used to examine the correlation between mosquito abundance peaks and the environmental drivers of peaks or troughs (low-density periods). The seasonal peaks of reproduction (r) and abundance (Npeak) occur at the beginning of September and early November, respectively. The combination of low mosquito abundance and a low frequency of a high tide exceeding 7 m in the previous low-abundance (trough) period were the most parsimonious predictors of a peak's magnitude, with this model explaining over 50{\%} of the deviance in Npeak. Model weights, estimated using AICc, were also relatively high for those including monthly maximum tide height, monthly accumulated tide height or total rainfall per month in the trough, with high values in the trough correlating negatively with the onset of a high-abundance peak. These findings illustrate that basic environmental monitoring data can be coupled with relatively simple density feedback models to predict the timing and magnitude of mosquito abundance peaks. Decision-makers can use these methods to determine optimal levels of control (i.e., least-cost measures yielding the largest decline in mosquito abundance) and so reduce the risk of disease outbreaks in human populations. {\textcopyright} 2009 Yang et al.},

abstract = {An improved understanding of mosquito population dynamics under natural environmental forcing requires adequate field observations spanning the full range of temporal scales over which mosquito abundance fluctuates in natural conditions. Here we analyze a 9-year daily time series of uninterrupted observations of adult mosquito abundance for multiple mosquito species in North Carolina to identify characteristic scales of temporal variability, the processes generating them, and the representativeness of observations at different sampling resolutions. We focus in particular on Aedes vexans and Culiseta melanura and, using a combination of spectral analysis and modeling, we find significant population fluctuations with characteristic periodicity between 2 days and several years. Population dynamical modelling suggests that the observed fast fluctuations scales (2 days-weeks) are importantly affected by a varying mosquito activity in response to rapid changes in meteorological conditions, a process neglected in most representations of mosquito population dynamics. We further suggest that the range of time scales over which adult mosquito population variability takes place can be divided into three main parts. At small time scales (indicatively 2 days-1 month) observed population fluctuations are mainly driven by behavioral responses to rapid changes in weather conditions. At intermediate scales (1 to several month) environmentally-forced fluctuations in generation times, mortality rates, and density dependence determine the population characteristic response times. At longer scales (annual to multiannual) mosquito populations follow seasonal and inter-annual environmental changes. We conclude that observations of adult mosquito populations should be based on a sub-weekly sampling frequency and that predictive models of mosquito abundance must include behavioral dynamics to separate the effects of a varying mosquito activity from actual changes in the abundance of the underlying population.
