\section{Discussion}

Mosquito-borne disease transmission is dependent on both natural and human environmental factors, such as climate, land use, health infrastructure, host demographics- using only climate will overestimate impact of climate change on populations \citep{Parham2015}

Aggregation of precipitation will lose the importance of quick torrential rains likely to flush immature mosquitoes \citep{Koenraadt2008}
